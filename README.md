Lally Homeschool Pi-Up-High project

This repo attempts to document what we've done in the Lally Homeschool for our high altitude balloon (HAB) project, named "pi-up-high" by the kids. This isn
t a curriculum, per se, but certainly a guideline with the code we wrote.

We started this project by just watching HAB launches on YouTube to understand the scope of the project as well as the art of the possible for something we had never done before. My main goals were to tech the kids practical applications of science and engineering in every day life, but also to have some fun!

The goals we set out at the beginning:
1. Get the balloon/payload to an altitude 100,000 ft
2. Capture still images and video in at least 2 different angles with a stretch goal of using 3 video cameras and 1 still camera.
3. In real-time, track the payload's altitude, atmospheric pressure, GPS location, and the forces exterted upon it
4. Do Step 3 in more than one way so we had some redundancy
5. Have fun!
